**Auto Crate Opener** is a toggle-driven, network manipulation and click-spamming automation utility crafted with the procedural scripting prowess of AutoHotkey v1.1. Its ostensible function—automatizing the opening of crates within the Roblox game environment by exploiting transient network interface resets—is undergirded by a precise orchestration of system command invocation, asynchronous timer-driven click emission, and GUI-stateful toggling mechanisms.



By leveraging repeated invocation of `ipconfig /release` and `ipconfig /renew`, this tool effectuates momentary network drops (*intermissio retis*), which in turn influence the Roblox client’s crate opening mechanics. Concurrently, a rapid-fire click spam (*cliques rapidus*) ensures interaction continuity during the toggled operation, all managed via a clean, user-centric GUI interface.

> **In simple terms:** it just turns your internet off and on for a fraction of a second (about 1ms) while spam-clicking. This seems to confuse Roblox and makes crate opening faster.
